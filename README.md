Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System

The adaptive traffic signal control system is designed to optimize traffic flow at intersections by adjusting signal timings in real-time based on current traffic conditions. The goal of the project is to reduce traffic congestion, minimize waiting times, and improve overall efficiency on busy roads.

This system uses sensors to gather real-time data on vehicle count, speed, and traffic density at a four-way intersection. The collected data is processed through a custom-built algorithm that dynamically adjusts the duration of green, yellow, and red lights. The system prioritizes roads with heavier traffic and can extend or shorten signal times accordingly.

Key Features:

Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: Sensors continuously monitor traffic flow at the intersection.
Dynamic Signal Adjustment: The algorithm calculates optimal signal durations based on the current traffic load, adapting to real-time conditions.
Reduced Congestion: The system minimizes vehicle idle time, reducing fuel consumption and emissions.
Scalability: The system can be deployed at multiple intersections and scaled across urban areas.
Integration of Hardware and Software: The project involves integrating hardware components (traffic sensors) with a software solution to automate signal control.
